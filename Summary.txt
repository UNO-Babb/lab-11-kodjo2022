Grocery Store Simulation Summary
Simulation Purpose:
This simulation modeled a grocery store where shoppers arrive randomly and need to checkout with a limited number of checkers.

Key Findings:

More checkers reduce customer wait time significantly.

Faster shopper arrivals  cause longer queues unless checkers are increased.

When arrival rate and checkout capacity are balanced, idle time for checkers is minimized and customer service is efficient.

If too few checkers are available, customer wait times grow dramatically.

Idle time happens when no customers are in line â€” typically with too many checkers or slow arrival rates.

Metrics we processed:

Average, maximum, and minimum customer wait times

Total customers served

Total checker idle time
